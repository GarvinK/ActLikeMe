## WHAT IS IT?

A multi-agent based simulation to show how social distancing affects the spread of a virus. Among other things it evaluates the evolution of infection rates, immunity and death rates. Thereby, takes into account how a potentially overwhelmed healthcare system cannot treat every patient optimally.



## HOW IT WORKS

The agents are arranged in a network with five connections to the closest neighbours. Initially the agents are distributed randomly, given the connection logic, this will result in a local clustering (which seems at least somewhat more realistic than to have all agents distributed randomly). The agents interact according to an adjustable probability,  which simulates how well someone acts according to the social distancing guidelines. The model still contains many random parts which are sampled from a uniform, which is NOT how reality works. The model still illustrates how social distancing can help mitigate the effects of a virus.

## HOW TO USE IT

Set the probability-of-contact variable. 

## THINGS TO NOTICE

There are some heavy assumptions, DO NOT TAKE THEM FOR GRANTED. This is an illustrative model WITHOUT ANY CLAIM TO CORRESPOND TO REALITY. The model aims merely to show how social distancing can help keeping the number of people infected (and therefore presumably the number of occupied hospital beds) within the capacity of the healthcare system. 

## THINGS TO TRY / EXTENDING THE MODEL

- Get some more accurate realistic parameters. 
- MonteCarlo the model many times to get parameter estimates of the curves instead of curves apt for visualisation. 
- include additional behavioural based parameters
